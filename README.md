## Description
In this project, we utilize web scraping techniques to collect data from various American Key Retailer websites. We then perform data transformation and cleaning using Python Pandas. Next, we use Power Query for additional data transformation. Following that, we use DAX for data modeling and building parameters. Finally, we build a dashboard in Power BI to visualize the insights derived from the data.

This project is designed to enhance your data science skills and can serve as a valuable addition to your resume. It provides a structured approach to data analytics and visualization, allowing you to gain practical experience in real-world data analysis scenarios.
